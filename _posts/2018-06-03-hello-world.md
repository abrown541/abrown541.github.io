# Hello World
#### Why I chose to start this blog 
I've just finished my degree at UC Berkeley and moved halfway accross the country to start a new job at Epic Systems. I'm ecstatic about Madison and the position, but any big change can be scary and I think a blog may help me organize my thoughts. More pertinent to why I chose to start this blog, is my leaving (escaping?) the structure and rigour of my degree progam. I no longer live in a world where my personal development is managed by due dates and evaluated by exams. Now, if I want to accomplish my goals I need to build my own plans set my own deadlines and decide for myself how well I achieved them. 

One of the things that I've been doing towards continuing my proffesional growth is listening the the [Complete Software Developers Career Guide](https://simpleprogrammer.com/products/careerguide/links/) on audio book. A piece of advice that he pounds into the ground is how important it is for a software developer to maintain a blog, and I agree though for different reasons than the ones he lists in his book. He sees a blog as a tool to build your career by networking with other profesionals in the industry and demonstrating your value by showing your expertise in relevant technologies. I think that this may become that one day, but in the meantime I'd prefer if no one ever read this so I can use this as a place to shout into the wind. 

The way I'd like to use this blog is as a place where I can log my journey as a software developer. I want to be able to look back in a year or two and see how much progress I've made. I want something I can put on my calendar to hold me accountable for continuing to grow and keep moving forward. I want a place to build my own structure and explicitly write down my self evaluations as I chronicle my mistakes and my successes. 

#### Structure
My plan right now is to spend fifteen minutes every day writing down what I did in a freeform manner, and then condense all of those loose thoughts into one weekly post on Sunday that actually gets put on the blog. From time to time if a freeform post stands on its own I'll put it up. I don't want to commit to something silly like posting daily, but at the same time I don't want to have to do too much in one sitting and I'd also like to get things down when they are fresh in my memory.

#### Preview
Next week I'll lay out what I'm currently working on, what my first week as a Software Developer was like, and maybe talk a bit more about the book I'm listening to.
